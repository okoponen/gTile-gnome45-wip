Changes to original repository
https://github.com/gTile/gTile/

- Remove support for older GNOME-versions
- Start to migrate import clauses to new format
- Add minor necessities, like export default, to support Gnome45

I have managed to migrate part of the imports via
    https://github.com/gjsify/ts-for-gir

specifically
    npx @ts-for-gir/cli generate
which generates the types to @types-directory

For whatever reason, seems that the npm-installed + imported via 
    @node_modules/@girs
do not work as assumed

What is missing
    - import * as Main from 'resource:///org/gnome/shell/ui/main.js';
        No idea currently, how to migrate these. Perhaps some manual migration via
        gresource list  /usr/share/gnome-shell/org.gnome.Extensions.data.gresource 
            /org/gnome/Extensions/dbus-interfaces/org.gnome.Shell.Extensions.xml
            /org/gnome/Extensions/style.css
            /org/gnome/Extensions/ui/extension-row.ui
            /org/gnome/Extensions/ui/extensions-window.ui
        gresource extract  /usr/share/gnome-shell/org.gnome.Extensions.data.gresource /org/gnome/Extensions/style.cs
        and marking these for import, would be needed

    - GIR-packages, that were not generated. Either find a way to generate these or find a way to get the 

    - "other" Gnome45 changes
